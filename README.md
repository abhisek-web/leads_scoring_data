# leads_scoring_data
This is a ipynb file based on logistic regression which gives a lead score to all the leads in an organization and the goal is to increase the leads conversion rate.
The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads.
